I am a 17-year old photographer based in the GTA with a strong interest in photography. I invest a lot of time in creative works, but I also offer high quality paid services. I am looking for local work and am happy to take on a variety of photography gigs.

Both my [creative](anandtphoto.ca/anand/creative) and [paid](anandtphoto.ca/anand/gigs) work are available on this website, and I encourage you to please take a look. I've worked over the years to develop my photography skills and I hope you enjoy, maybe enough to want to [work with me](anandtphoto.ca/anand/services) :)

Any form of support is appreciated, even an Instagram follow. [My Instagram page](instagram.com/anand_t_photography/) is dedicated to my creative works and I try to post pretty frequently.
